""" This example shows how to use your own instrument geometries in OpenWind"""

# In OpenWind, an instrument is described by its bore, i.e., the radius of the
# main pipe along its length.

# For instruments consisting only of conical parts, the information can consist
# in a list of coordinates (x,r), with x the abscissa along the linearized bore
# length (measured from the mouth-end of the instrument), and r the radius at
# this abscissa, in meters.

# Then, use the InstrumentGeometry module to create the OpenWind model of your
# instrument.


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For example, you can write the geometry directly in the OW code :
#           x [meters]       r [meters]
my_bore = [[0.0000000e+00, 8.4000000e-03],
           [1.2000000e-02, 2.4195678e-03],
           [1.7734052e-02, 1.8250000e-03],
           [8.3704052e-02, 4.2000000e-03],
           [3.0370405e-01, 5.8200000e-03],
           [1.0227041e+00, 7.3900000e-03],
           [1.2977041e+00, 1.4375000e-02],
           [1.4187041e+00, 6.1000000e-02]]

instrument_1 = InstrumentGeometry(my_bore)

# you can visualize the bore :
fig1 = plt.figure(1)  # create new figure
instrument_1.plot_InstrumentGeometry(figure=fig1)  # plot the instrument
plt.title('a simple instrument')  # add a title to the plot


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For large and/or detailed instruments, this list can grow very fast. OpenWind
# can therefore also import text files to make a model of the instrument.
# Note that the files parsed by this methods must be in csv format, with
# columns separated by spaces and/or tabs. First column is the linearized
# absissa, second column is the radius. Comments start with #. Empty lines are
# ignored.

file = 'Ex1_instrument_2.txt'
instrument_2 = InstrumentGeometry(file)

fig2 = plt.figure(2)  # create new figure
instrument_2.plot_InstrumentGeometry(figure=fig2)  # plot the instrument
plt.title('instrument from file')  # add a title to the plot


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Some shapes are not easily described by conical parts. OpenWind supports
# different types of shapes, that can easilly be mixed together in the same
# instrument.
# Each of these shape need to be defined in a precise way ('Formatting')
#  The different shapes are :
# - 'linear' : conical portion (same as above). Formatting : [x1, x2, r1, r2] ;
#              Draws a straight line between [x1, r1] and [x2, r2]

# - 'circle' : an arc of a circle. Formatting : [x1, x2, r1, r2, 'circle', R]
#              Draws an arc between [x1, r1] and [x2, r2] with radius R

# - 'exponential' : Formatting [x1, x2, r1, r2, 'exponential'] ;
#              Draws an exponential line between [x1, r1] and [x2, r2]

# - 'Bessel' : Formatting [x1, x2, r1, r2, 'bessel', alpha] ;
#              Draws a line based on a Bessel function, where alpha is the
#              coefficient of the bessel (=power)

# - 'spline' : Smooth function with control points.
#              Formatting [x1, x2, r1, r2, 'spline', x3,..., xN, r3,..., rN] ;
#              Draws a smooth line between [x1, r1] and [x2, r2], passing
#              through the control points (x3, r3) ... (xN, rN)

# load the instrument from the file :
instrument_3 = InstrumentGeometry('Ex1_instrument_3.txt')

fig3 = plt.figure(3)  # create new figure
instrument_3.plot_InstrumentGeometry(figure=fig3)  # plot the instrument
plt.title('a more complicated and smooth instrument')  # add a title

# Handling instrument side holes is the topic of Example 2 !
