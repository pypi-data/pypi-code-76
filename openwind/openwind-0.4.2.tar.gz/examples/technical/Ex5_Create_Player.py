""" This example shows how to create your Player"""

# In order to perform a temporal computation in Openwind, you will have to
# create a player.
#
# A player consists in a couple Excitator / Score
#
# Excitators are initiated from excitator parameters dictionnaries which you can
# find in openwind/technical/default_excitator_parameters. The default one is
# UNITARY_FLOW, which looks like this:
#
# UNITARY_FLOW = {
#     "excitator_type":"Flow",
#     "input_flow":1
# }
#
# You can see that the excitator is a Flow, and it's value is constant and
# equal to one.
#
# It is important to understand that you can choose between several kinds of
# excitators (Flow and Valve at the moment), and according to the excitator type
# you will have different excitator parameters. Parameters are time dependant
# functions (or curves) or constant values. For a Flow, you will only have
# "input_flow" as a parameter. For a Valve, you will have "opening",
# "mass", "section", "pulsation", "dissip", "width", "mouth_pressure", "model",
# "contact_pulsation" and "contact_exponent". You can have a glimpse at the code
# here: openwind/continuous/excitator.py
#
#
# A Score is defined by a list of note_events and a transition_duration.
# - note_events are tuples with the note name and the starting time of the note
# - transition_duration is a float which give the duration between two notes
#
# Now, let's see how we create a player
#
#
# Starting by creating a default player
player = Player()

# player's Excitator is a "UNITARY_FLOW", and it's Score is empty


# 1. PLAYER MODIFICATION

# You can now change the value of the input_flow of the score
player.update_curve("input_flow",2*np.pi*3700)

# Or you can create a custom_flow dictionnary and update the player with it
custom_flow = {
    "excitator_type":"Flow",
    "input_flow": constant_with_initial_ramp(2000, 2e-2)
}
player.update_curves(custom_flow)
# pay attention to the "s" at the end of update_curves, it is not the same
# method as above

# you can check the new value of your input_flow for t =[-5,5] :
time_interval = np.linspace(-5,5,1000)
player.plot_one_control("input_flow",time_interval)

# Of course, you can update your player with all excitator dictionnaries
# that are stored in default_excitator_parameters:
player.set_defaults("IMPULSE_400us")


# IMPORTANT NOTE: if your player was created with a Flow excitator, you can not
# change it to another type of excitator. This is forbidden to prevent misusage
# of the code. If you want to use a Valve instead of a Flow, you must create a
# new Player

# Let's say we want to have a player that plays Oboe:
oboe_player = Player("OBOE")

# oboe_player is using this Excitator :
# OBOE = {
#     "excitator_type" : "Valve",
#     "opening" : 8.9e-5,
#     "mass" : 7.1e-4,
#     "section" : 4.5e-5,
#     "pulsation" : 2*np.pi*600,
#     "dissip" : 0.4*2*np.pi*600,
#     "width" : 9e-3,
#     "mouth_pressure" : constant_with_initial_ramp(12000, 2e-2),
#     "model" : "reed",
#     "contact_pulsation": 316,
#     "contact_exponent": 4
# }

# Let's say you want to change the mouth pressure value, once again :
oboe_player.update_curve("mouth_pressure",
                         constant_with_initial_ramp(13000, 2e-2))

# You can plot all controls for the oboe_player :
oboe_player.plot_controls(time_interval)

# At some point, if you got lost with your player, you can check which
# default dictionnaries availables

oboe_player.print_defaults()
oboe_player.set_defaults("REED")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# 2. SCORE MODIFICATION

# If you want to modify your Score, first create a new note_events list :
note_events = [('note1', .02), ('note2', .03), ('note1', .04)]
# Then you can change the transition_duration:
transition_duration = 1e-3

oboe_player.update_score(note_events, transition_duration)
