""" This example shows how to simplify a complicated instrument geometry"""

# If you wish to import a real existing instrument to OpenWind, you probably
# have access to it's bore, either via measurements or directly from the
# maker's plan.
# If you measured a real instrument, you have noted the radius of the bore at
# different points of the instrument - the more precise the measurement, the
# smaller the distance between the measurement points and therefore the more
# data.

# In OpenWind, calculating the acoustic behaviour of an instrument with a large
# amount of parts can take a (very) long time.
# Moreover, these data points can be noisy (due to measurements errors).
# This is why it is interesting to simplify a complicated instrument
# geometry.


# we load a complex instrument with a lot of segments
complex_instr = InstrumentGeometry('Ex3_complex_instrument.txt')

fig1 = plt.figure(1)  # create new figure
complex_instr.plot_InstrumentGeometry(figure=fig1)  # plot the instrument
plt.title('A complex and noisy measurement with a lot of segments')

# The geometry simplification is done by an optimization process. We need to
# give OpenWind a starting shape and set the values we want to be optimized
# by writing them between '' and with a tilde ~ in front.

# Here we try to simplify our instrument down to 8 linear segments, where the
# lengths of the segments are fixed, and the radii are to be optimized.

# We need to help OpenWind a bit more.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
